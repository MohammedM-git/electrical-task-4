# **electrical-task-4-1**  

**Control Circuit for G3 U10 AIR1 M0**  
This setup manages an **air switch (AIR1)** and **motor (M0)** in **Unit 10 (U10)** of **Group 3 (G3)**.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **AIR1 (Air Switch)**  
   - Triggers or interrupts the circuit based on air pressure/flow.  
   - Acts as a safety or control switch for the motor.  

2. **M0 (Motor)**  
   - Activated/deactivated by the AIR1 signal.  
   - Likely drives a conveyor, fan, or pneumatic system.  

### **What’s Included**  
- Wiring diagram or logic for **G3 U10 AIR1 M0**.  
- Basic control behavior (e.g., motor starts when AIR1 is engaged).  

*(Adjust specifics based on your actual circuit function!)*
