# **electrical-task-4-1**  

**Control Circuit for G3 U10 AIR1 M0**  
This setup manages an **air switch (AIR1)** and **motor (M0)** in **Unit 10 (U10)** of **Group 3 (G3)**.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **AIR1 (Air Switch)**  
   - Triggers or interrupts the circuit based on air pressure/flow.  
   - Acts as a safety or control switch for the motor.  

2. **M0 (Motor)**  
   - Activated/deactivated by the AIR1 signal.  
   - Likely drives a conveyor, fan, or pneumatic system.  

### **What’s Included**  
- Wiring diagram or logic for **G3 U10 AIR1 M0**.  
- Basic control behavior (e.g., motor starts when AIR1 is engaged).

# **IC-510A-Circuit**

**electrical-task-4-2**  
This circuit uses the IC-510A chip to manage business and travel services automation.

### **How It Works**  
1. **DEC Module**  
   - Processes all system decisions  
   - Routes commands to appropriate components  

2. **UNO Interface**  
   - Provides Arduino UNO compatibility  
   - Enables system programming and control  

3. **ANDUMN Unit**  
   - Checks multiple conditions simultaneously  
   - Only activates outputs when all inputs are valid
